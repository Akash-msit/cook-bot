Creating a Cooking Assistant Chatbot Using RAG Architecture
Project Overview
This project involves creating a Cooking Assistant Chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. The chatbot leverages Google Gemini LLM for generating human-like responses and ChromaDB for embedding storage and retrieval. The chatbot is designed to assist users with cooking recipes, tips, and ingredient information by efficiently retrieving relevant knowledge and augmenting it with generative AI capabilities.

Key Features
Efficient Recipe Retrieval: Retrieve recipes and cooking tips from stored documents.
Dynamic Response Generation: Provide personalized and context-aware responses using Google Gemini LLM.
Scalable Embedding Management: Use ChromaDB for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.
Seamless Integration: Easily extendable to include additional recipes or information.
